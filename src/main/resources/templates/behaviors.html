				            <p>Social interaction refers to the skills and behaviors involved in communication and participation in social activities with others. In children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), social interaction can be challenging due to difficulties in understanding social cues, emotional reciprocity, and sharing skills.

						<div class="behavior">
							<h5>8. Concentration:</h5>
							<p>Concentration refers to the ability to direct and maintain focus on a specific task, blocking external and internal distractions. In children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), difficulties in concentration can occur due to issues such as hyper or hypo responsiveness to sensory stimuli, restricted interest in certain subjects, and difficulties in filtering stimuli. Monitoring concentration involves observing the child's ability to maintain focus on specific activities, as well as identifying factors that may interfere with concentration, such as excessive noise or intense visual stimuli. This information can help adapt the environment and support strategies to optimize the child's concentration and engagement in academic and social activities.</p>
