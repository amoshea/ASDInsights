                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a "developmental disorder" because symptoms generally appear in the first 2 years of life.
            </p>

            <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                <li>Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people</li>
                <li>Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors</li>
                <li>Symptoms that affect their ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify">
            Autism is known as a "spectrum" disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify">
            People of all genders, races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds can be diagnosed with ASD. Although ASD can be a lifelong disorder, treatments and services can improve a person's symptoms and daily functioning. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children receive screening for autism. Caregivers should talk to their child’s health care provider about ASD screening or evaluation.

Since autism is not an illness and therefore can't be "cured," the goal is to help a child gain and hone communication, interpersonal, and behavioral skills to better navigate daily life and, 
                
                whenever possible, function independently. <br><br>
                
                This may involve a variety of different therapies, including speech therapy and social skills therapy, as well as prescription drugs to help manage issues with focus and commonly co-occurring mental illnesses. Lifestyle modifications and practices can help reinforce the goals of therapy at home. <br><br>

                
                This article looks at the various treatments that may be used if a child is diagnosed with autism. It also explores the role that complementary and alternative therapies may play in the treatment plan. <a class="article-btm" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/autism-treatment-4014208">Read article</a></p>
